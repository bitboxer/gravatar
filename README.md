# Gravatar

This is the gravatar I am using everywhere on the net.

Currently it looks like this:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/bitboxer/gravatar/master/gravatar_borderless.png" width="256" height="256"/>

I used a pixeled version of this since at least 1998 till october 2012.
The screen resolutions nowadays are higher than back then. Because of
that I needed a higher resolution for that image. With the current SVG
I should be safe for the next decade :) .

The old picture looked like this:
