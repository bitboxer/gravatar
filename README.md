# Gravatar

This is the gravatar I am using everywhere on the net.

Currently it looks like this:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/bitboxer/gravatar/master/gravatar.png" width="256" height="256"/>

I used a pixeled version of this since at least 2001 till october 2012.
Since I needed a higher resolution for that image I recreated it using svg.

The old picture looked like this:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/bitboxer/gravatar/master/old_avatar.png" width="16" height="16"/>
